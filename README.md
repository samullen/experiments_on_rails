## README

I don't always have the freedom to experiment with ideas as I work on a project.
Sometimes it's because the project is too far along, or because the client
doesn't want to pay for me to play around. This application affords me the
opportunity to experiment and see what works without worrying about how a real
world application is affected.

A more indepth explanation of [Experiments on Rails](http://samuelmullen.com/2015/02/experiments-on-rails/) can be found on [my site](http://samuelmullen.com/2015/02/experiments-on-rails/).
